### What I learned

After learning some basic concepts, I decided to take some practice by creating a little project using actual tasks. The most difficult part was to move the object to the center of the screen; I lost about half the time to find ways and implement them into my solution.

For the final solution I left this code: 

```css
position: fixed;
top: 50%;
left: 50%;
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```
This task took 2 hours to complete instead of the expected 0.5.
